### :black_medium_small_square: Project Context
This is one of the required projects for earning the Responsive Web Design certification on freeCodeCamp. It helped me improve my understanding of how to create responsive, functional, and stylish portfolio pages. It's a great example of combining both **design skills** and **technical skills**.
